<h2>Boodler: Programming Reference</h2>

Herein are described four classes. 
<p>

Okay, three classes and a module.
<p>

<ul>

base class for boodler agents
<li><a href="#eventagent">EventAgent</a>: 
base class for boodler agents that listen for events

</ul>

<hr>

<h3><a name="agent">Agent</a>: 
base class for boodler agents</h3>

<ul>
<li>Methods and fields to be overridden:
<dl>

<dt>name
<dd>a string which describes the agent
<dt>run()
<dd>perform the agent's action
<dt>getname()
<dd>return a string which describes the agent
</dl>

<li>Publically readable fields:
<dl>
<dt>channel
<dd>the channel in which this agent is running
</dl>

<li>Methods which can be called from a run() method:
<dl>
<dt>sched_note()
<dd>schedule a note to be played
<dt>sched_note_duration()
<dd>schedule a note to be played for an extended time
<dt>sched_note_pan()
<dd>schedule a note to be played at a stereo position
<dt>sched_note_params()
<dd>schedule a note, allowing all parameters
<dt>sched_agent()
<dd>schedule another agent to run
<dt>resched()
<dd>schedule self to run again
<dt>post_agent()
<dd>post another agent to watch for events
<dt>send_event()
<dd>create an event, which posted agents may receive
<dt>new_channel()
<dd>create a channel
<dt>new_channel_pan()
<dd>create a channel at a stereo position
<dt>get_root_channel()
<dd>return the root channel of the channel tree
</dl>
</ul>

<hr>

<dl>

<dt><code>sched_note(sample [, pitch=1, volume=1, delay=0, chan=self.channel]) -&gt; duration</code>
<p>

<dd>
Schedule a note to play. The sound is loaded from the file sample
(which is relative to $BOODLER_SOUND_PATH). The pitch is given as a
multiple of the sound's original frequency; the volume is given
as a fraction of the sound's original volume. The delay is a time
(in seconds) to delay before the note is played. The channel,
if <code>None</code> or not supplied, defaults to the same channel the agent is
running in.
<p>

This returns the expected duration of the sound, in seconds.
<p>

<dt><code>sched_note_pan(sample [, pan=0, pitch=1, volume=1, delay=0, chan=self.channel]) -&gt; duration</code>
<p>

<dd>
Schedule a note to play, panning the stereo origin of the sound.
The pan value defaults to 0, meaning no shift in origin;
-1 means all the way left; 1 means all the way right. The value
may also be an object created by the <code>stereo</code> module.
<p>

The sound is loaded from the file sample (which is relative to 
$BOODLER_SOUND_PATH). The pitch is given as a multiple of the
sound's original frequency; the volume is given as a fraction
of the sound's original volume. The delay is a time (in seconds)
to delay before the note is played. The channel, if <code>None</code> or not
supplied, defaults to the same channel the agent is running in.
<p>

This returns the expected duration of the sound, in seconds.
<p>

<dt><code>sched_note_duration(sample, duration [, pitch=1, volume=1, delay=0, chan=self.channel]) -&gt; duration</code>
<p>

<dd>
Schedule a note to play, extending the original sound sample to a
longer period of time. The duration is given in seconds. 
<p>

The sound is loaded from the file sample (which is relative to 
$BOODLER_SOUND_PATH). The pitch is given as a multiple of the
sound's original frequency; the volume is given as a fraction
of the sound's original volume. The delay is a time (in seconds)
to delay before the note is played. The channel, if <code>None</code> or not
supplied, defaults to the same channel the agent is running in.
<p>

This returns the expected duration of the sound, in seconds. Due to
the way sounds are looped, this may be slightly longer than the
given duration.
<p>

<dt><code>sched_note_params(sample [, param=value, param=value...]) -&gt; duration</code>
<p>

<dd>
Schedule a note to play. This method understands all the arguments
used by the other sched_note methods, but they must be supplied as
named keywords. The arguments may be in any order.
For example: "self.sched_note_params(snd, volume=0.5, pitch=2)"
<p>

The valid arguments, and their default values:
<ul>
<li><code>pitch = 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> (original pitch)
<li><code>volume = 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> (full volume)
<li><code>delay = 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> (play immediately)
<li><code>pan = None&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> (no stereo shift)
<li><code>duration = 0&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> (exactly once through the sound)
<li><code>chan = None&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> (play in agent's own channel)
</ul>
<p>

<dt><code>post_agent(agent [, chan=self.channel])</code>
<p>

<dd>
Post an agent to watch for events; the agent will be scheduled to
run whenever an appropriate event occurs. The channel, if <code>None</code>
or not supplied, defaults to the same channel that self is running
in.
<p>

The posted agent must be an instance of the <code>EventAgent</code> class.
It must have a <code>watch_events</code> field, which lists the
events which it is interested in. This field must be a string,
a list of strings, or a function such that <code>agent.watch_events()</code>
return a string or list of strings.
<p>

<dt><code>send_event(event)</code>
<p>

<dd>
Send an event. Boodler interprets the event just as if it had
been received from the outside world. Any agents that are posted
watching for that type of event will run. (Due to the way the
scheduler works, there may be a short delay before they run.
The delay is <em>not</em> predictable. For reliable scheduling, use
sched_agent(), not send_event().)
<p>

The event should be a tuple of strings, or a string (which will
be split into a tuple at whitespace).
<p>

<dt><code>sched_agent(agent [, delay=0, chan=self.channel])</code>
<p>

<dd>
Schedule an agent to run. This may be the current agent (self) or 
a newly-created agent. The delay is a time (in seconds) to delay
before the agent runs. The channel, if <code>None</code> or not supplied,
defaults to the same channel that self is running in.
<p>

<dt><code>resched([delay, chan=self.channel])</code>
<p>

<dd>
Reschedule the current agent (self). The delay is a time (in
seconds) to delay before the agent runs again. The channel, if
<code>None</code> or not supplied, defaults to the same channel that self is
running in.
<p>

If delay is not supplied, it defaults to the delay used when this
agent was first scheduled. Note that if this value was zero, 
you will probably cause an infinite loop.
<p>

<dt><code>new_channel([startvolume=1, parent=self.channel]) -&gt; channel</code>
<p>

<dd>
Create a new channel. The startvolume is the volume the channel
is initially set to; this will affect all sounds played in the
channel and any subchannels. The new channel will be a subchannel
of parent -- if <code>None</code> or not supplied, it will be a subchannel of
the channel that the agent (self) is running in.
<p>

<dt><code>new_channel_pan([pan=stereo.default(), startvolume=1, parent=self.channel]) -&gt; channel</code>
<p>

<dd>
Create a new channel, panning the stereo origin of its sounds.
(See the <code>stereo</code> module.) The startvolume is the volume the channel
is initially set to; this will affect all sounds played in the
channel and any subchannels. The new channel will be a subchannel
of parent -- if <code>None</code> or not supplied, it will be a subchannel of
the channel that the agent (self) is running in.
<p>

<dt><code>get_root_channel() -&gt; channel</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return the root channel of the channel tree.
<p>

<dt><code>run()</code>
<p>

<dd>
Perform the agent's action. Each subclass of Agent must override
this method.
<p>

<dt><code>getname() -&gt; string</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return the name of the agent. This defaults to returning 
<code>self.name</code>, if that is defined.
<p>

</dl>

<hr>

<h3><a name="eventagent">EventAgent</a>: 
base class for boodler agents that listen for events</h3>

See Agent class definition for inherited methods and fields.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Methods and fields to be overridden:
<dl>

<dt>run()
<dd>defaults to <code>post_agent(self)</code>
<dt>receive()
<dd>perform the agent's action
<dt>watch_events
<dd>events to watch for (this may be a string, a list of 
  strings, or a method that returns a string or list of strings)
</dl>

<li>Methods which can be called:
<dl>
<dt>unpost()
<dd>remove self from event-watching post
</dl>

</ul>

<hr>

<dl>

<dt><code>run()</code>
<p>

<dd>
By default, this calls <code>post_agent(self)</code>. In most cases, you will
not want to override this.
<p>

<dt><code>receive(event)</code>
<p>

<dd>
Perform the agent's action when an appropriate event arrives. 
Each subclass of <code>EventAgent</code> must override this method.
The event is a tuple of one or more strings.
<p>

<dt><code>unpost()</code>
<p>

<dd>
Remove self from event-watching post.
<p>

</dl>

<hr>

<h3><a name="channel">Channel</a>: 
a class for creating hierarchical trees of sounds and agents</h3>

Channel objects should be created via <code>Agent.new_channel()</code> and
destroyed with the <code>channel.stop()</code> method.

<ul>
<li>Public methods and fields:
<dl>
<dt>parent
<dd>the parent of the channel (None if root)
<dt>get_root_channel()
<dd>return the root channel of the tree
<dt>set_volume()
<dd>change the volume of the channel
<dt>stop()
<dd>stop the channel immediately
</dl>
</ul>

<hr>

<dl>

<dt><code>stop()</code>
<p>

<dd>
Stop the channel immediately. All sounds playing in the channel 
(or any subchannels) are cut off; all sounds and agents scheduled
to run are discarded.
<p>

If any notes are playing with non-zero volume, their termination
may cause undesirable clicks and pops. It is best to set the volume
of a channel to zero before stopping it. (The <code>FadeOutAgent</code> class
can be used for this.)
<p>

Due to the way sound generation is buffered, when an agent calls
<code>channel.stop()</code>, the channel may be stopped slightly later than
it ought to be.
<p>

<dt><code>get_root_channel() -&gt; channel</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return the root channel of the tree.
<p>

<dt><code>set_volume(newvolume [, interval=0.005])</code>
<p>

<dd>
Change the volume of the channel to a new level (0 means silence,
1 means full volume). This affects all notes in the channel and
any subchannels.
<p>

The volume change begins immediately, and occurs smoothly over
the interval given (in seconds). If no value is given, the interval
defaults to 0.005 (five milliseconds), which is short enough that
it will sound instantaneous. (You should not use an interval
shorter than 0.005; it can cause undesirable clicks and pops.)
<p>

Due to the way the volume code is written (a cheap and dirty hack),
two volume changes scheduled too close together on the same channel
(within about one second) can interfere with each other. The earlier
one may be ignored entirely in favor of the later. Therefore, you
should not rely on rapid sequences of <code>set_volume()</code> calls for your
sound effects. Set volumes on individual notes instead, or else
create several channels.
<p>

<h3><a name="stereo">stereo</a>: 
a module of stereo pan objects</h3>

This is a separate module, <em>not</em> a class of methods. Each function
is a top-level function in the module.
<p>

These functions are for creating stereo panning description objects.
A stereo object is a stereo shift, a contraction, or a combination of
these. (See <a href="design-basics.html">Soundscape Basics</a>.)
Stereo objects can be passed
to <code>new_channel_pan()</code> or <code>sched_note_pan()</code>.
<p>

Note that in the current implementation, stereo objects are represented
by simple tuples, or by <code>None</code> (for the default stereo position).
You should not rely on this remaining true. I may get cleverer in a future
release, and re-implement them as a Python class. Use the utility
functions.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Module functions:
<dl>

<dt>default()
<dd>return the default stereo position
<dt>shift()
<dd>return a simple stereo shift
<dt>scale()
<dd>return a stretched or compressed stereo effect
<dt>fixed()
<dd>return a stereo effect which is compressed to a point
<dt>compose()
<dd>apply one stereo effect on top of another
<dt>cast()
<dd>convert an object to a stereo effect
</dl>

</ul>

<hr>

<dl>

<dt><code>default() -&gt; stereo</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return a stereo object which describes the default stereo position --
no shift, no contraction.
<p>

<dt><code>shift(pos) -&gt; stereo</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return a simple stereo shift. If pos is zero, there is no shift in
origin; this returns the default stereo position. -1 means all the
way left; 1 means all the way right.
<p>

<dt><code>scale(size) -&gt; stereo</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return a stereo effect which is not shifted left or right, but is
compressed or stretched from the center. If size is less than 1,
the channels are compressed; zero causes every sound to be perfectly
centered. If size is greater than 1, the channels are spread apart.
Negative values cause the left and right channels to swap.
<p>

<dt><code>fixed(pos) -&gt; stereo</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return a stereo effect which is compressed to a point. All sounds
contained in this effect, no matter how shifted, will come from a
single point. If pos is zero, this will be the center; if -1, the
left side; if 1, the right.
<p>

<code>fixed(pos)</code> is equivalent to 
<code>compose(shift(pos), scale(0))</code>.
You figure it out.
<p>

<dt><code>compose(stereo1, stereo2) -&gt; stereo</code>
<p>

<dd>
Return a stereo effect which is the result of applying of stereo1
on top of stereo2. This is the equivalent of a channel set to
stereo1, containing a channel stereo2.
<p>

<dt><code>cast(obj) -&gt; stereo</code>
<p>

<dd>
Convert obj into a stereo object. If obj is <code>None</code>, this returns the
default stereo position. If obj is a number, this returns a simple
stereo shift -- no scaling. If obj is a stereo object, this returns
it (or an equivalent object).
