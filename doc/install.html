<h1>Boodler: Installation</h1>

<p>
Boodler uses the standard Python distutils system for building and
installation.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
First, download and unpack the source code from the
<a href="http://boodler.org/">Boodler web site</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Boodler is written in Python; you must have a Python interpreter installed
on your system in order to run it. (Python version 2.3.5 or later is 
recommended. No, it doesn't work in Python 3.)
</p>

<p>
Boodler can generate audio output in any of several forms, each of
which is defined by a driver module:
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>file</code> --   write file containing raw sample output</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> -- write raw sample output to stdout</li>
<li><code>oss</code> --    Open Sound System</li>
<li><code>esd</code> --    Enlightened Sound Daemon</li>
<li><code>alsa</code> --   Advanced Linux Sound Architecture</li>
<li><code>macosx</code> -- MacOSX CoreAudio</li>
<li><code>vorbis</code> -- write Ogg Vorbis file</li>
<li><code>shout</code> --  Shoutcast or Icecast source</li>
<li><code>lame</code> --   write MP3 file with LAME encoder</li>
</ul>

<p>
Boodler will compile all of these drivers that it can find libraries for.
If you have a Mac, CoreAudio is available if you have the Mac Developer
Tools installed. On Linux, one of OSS, ESD, or ALSA is likely to be
available.
</p>

<h2>The contents of the archive</h2>

<p>
If you list the source directory, you will see the following arrangement:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>./setup.py</dt>
<dd>A script which compiles and installs Boodler on your machine.</dd>
<dt>./setup.cfg</dt>
<dd>If you want to modify the installation process, you can put changes
here.</dd>
<dt>./script/<a href="boodler-ref.html">boodler.py</a></dt>
<dd>The Boodler program itself. This Python script starts up the Boodler
engine.</dd>
<dt>./script/<a href="boodle-mgr-ref.html">boodle-mgr.py</a></dt>
<dd>A script for installing and managing Boodler soundscape components.</dd>
<dt>./script/<a href="boodle-event-ref.html">boodle-event.py</a></dt>
<dd>A simple script for sending network events to Boodler.</dd>
<dt>./src/...</dt>
<dd>The source code for Boodler. This includes Python code, and also
some native C code which is needed to resample sound data efficiently.</dd>
<dt>./etc/...</dt>
<dd>A few optional configuration files.</dd>
<dt>./doc/*.html</dt>
<dd>This documentation.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Building Boodler</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Type <em>python setup.py build</em>.
</p>

<p>
This tries to figure out the configuration of your system, and compiles
the Boodler modules which can be compiled.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Type <em>sudo python setup.py install</em>.
</p>

<p>
This installs Boodler in the system's Python directory. The 
<code>sudo</code> command will ask you for your password, which the 
setup script needs to write to a system directory. If you want to
install to a different directory, you could instead type:
</p>

<p>
<em>python setup.py install --prefix <code>directory</code></em>
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Testing Boodler out</h2>

<p>
Try this command:
</p>

<pre>
boodler.py --testsound
</pre>

<p>
You should hear a quick melody of test tones -- first alternating
between left and right channels, and then playing in both.
</p>

<p>
You can now begin <a href="use.html">using Boodler</a>.
</p>

<h2>If it doesn't work</h2>

<ul>

<li>
You're trying to build Boodler, and you see the error "Python.h: No such 
file or directory".

<ul>
<li>Probably you don't have the Python development package installed on
your machine. This is the set of include files needed to compile C
modules for Python.</li>
<li>If your OS uses RPM packages (Red Hat format),
find the "python-devel" RPM package; if you use some other installation
system, the name will be something similar. Make sure you get the headers
that match your version of Python.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
You install successfully, but you get the error
"boodler.py: Command not found."

<ul>
<li>
You probably don't have the Python script directory in your 
<code>PATH</code>. Try <code>/usr/local/bin/boodler.py</code>, or
(on the Mac)
<code>/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/boodler.py</code>.</li>
<li>
If you think you added one of those directories to your <code>PATH</code>,
type <code>rehash</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
The script aborts with the exception 
"ImportError: No module named cboodle_oss" or
"No Boodler output driver has been selected."

<ul>
<li>
The default output driver could not be built on your system. Type
<code>boodler.py --list-drivers</code> to see a list, and then
try adding <code>-o <em>driver</em></code> to your Boodler command
line.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
The script aborts with the exception
"IOError: unable to initialize audio device".

<ul>
<li>
The <code>boodle.cboodle</code> module was unable to open the sound
device. The first line of the error message will have a more specific
explanation.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Boodler cannot initialize the audio device because 
<code>/dev/dsp</code> is not found.

<ul>
<li>
You may have your sound device installed
in a different location. You can use the <code>--device</code> argument
to indicate the correct location:

<pre>
boodler.py --device /dev/whatever --testsound
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Boodler appears to hang forever, never producing any sound.

<ul>
<li>Some other
program may be using the sound device.</li>
<li>
When Boodler is built using the OSS or ALSA interfaces, it is a greedy beast
and insists on monopolizing the sound device itself, the entire time
it is running. 
When Boodler is built using ESD, it is willing to share with other
ESD programs, but it is still possible for some other program to 
hog the device and prevent ESD from starting up.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Boodler runs for a few seconds and then stops,
but you hear no sound.

<ul>
<li>
You need to mess around with your speakers,
headphones, cables, or some other irritating piece of the real world.
</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
Most soundscapes skip or sound choppy.

<ul>
<li>Your computer is unable to keep up with Boodler's computation.
(This is unlikely on a modern desktop machine, but it could happen
on an older or low-power device.)</li>
<li>Run fewer applications at the same time as Boodler.</li>
<li>Try rebuilding Boodler using the 
<code>python configure.py --integer</code> configuration option.
This reduces the number of floating-point operations, at the cost
of less accurate volume fading.</li>
<li>If you are using MacOSX, increase the number of sound buffers,
using the <code>--define buffercount=<em>count</em></code> option.
The default is 6; increasing it to 12 or 16 should help:
<pre>
boodler.py --define buffercount=12 --testsound
</pre>
</li>
<li>Get a beefier computer.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
You hear clipping noise (mild static) in some soundscapes.

<ul>
<li>You need to reduce the amplitude of Boodler's sound stream as it
passes through your drivers. There are two ways of doing this:</li>
<li>Use a mixer application (such as <code>xmixer</code>,
<code>amixer</code>, or <code>alsamixer</code>) to reduce the 
"PCM" component of your sound driver. You can compensate
by turning up the "Master" component, or just turning up your speakers.</li>
<li>Or, use the <code>--master</code> argument to Boodler, giving it a
master mixing volume <em>less</em> than the default of 0.5. 
Again, you can compensate with a mixer application or by turning up
your speakers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
