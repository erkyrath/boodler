<h2>Boodler: Licensing</h2>

The licensing situation regarding Boodler is somewhat ornate, because
there are many components involved. (The script <code>boodler.py</code>,
the Boodler library, the sounds in the Boodler sound library, the pieces
of code that make up the soundscape agents.) 
<p>

I have tried to keep the hassle to a minimum. If you are running Boodler
for your own private, non-commercial use, you shouldn't have to worry about
any of this. However, if you intend to use Boodler in a public or broadcast
setting, or in a commercial, for-profit way, or if you intend to incorporate
Boodler in some other project or program, you should read the following.

<h3><a name="using">LICENSING FOR USERS</a></h3>
<h4><em>(Running Boodler)</em></h4>

Boodler is free software, and you may run it freely. (Portions of the
Boodler source code are copyrighted and licensed under the LGPL, and
other portions are public domain. Neither of these restrict you in any
way from running the program.)
<p>

However, there is another legal issue. Boodler operates by combining
sound-sample files into a ongoing stream of sound -- a soundscape.
Legally speaking, when you run it, you are creating a derivative work
based on those sound files.
<p>

The sound files in the Boodler sound library are <em>not</em> all in the
public domain. Most of them are licensed "for private and
non-commercial use only". Some were found by random searching around
the web, and appear without any copyright statement at all.
<p>

It is my opinion (<em>not</em> backed by any legal advice) that if you run
Boodler for your own private use, using the Boodler sound library, you
are within the scope of fair use and the "non-commercial use" licenses
of those sounds.
<p>

However, if you play the sound output of Boodler (based on the Boodler
sound library) as a commercial performance, or include it in a
recording sold for profit, you may not be complying with the copyright
restrictions on those sounds. You will have to look at the README
files in the sound library and decide whether your performance is
legal.
<p>

Note that this legal issue is solely a problem of playing particular
sounds from the Boodler sound library. If you create your own Boodler
soundscape, based solely on <em>your own</em> sound-sample files, then that
stream of sound is entirely your own work; you may do with it as you
wish.
<p>

<h3><a name="extending">LICENSING FOR SOUNDSCAPE DESIGNERS</a></h3>
<h4><em>(Extending the effects)</em></h4>

The Python scripts included in the ./effects directory are in the
public domain. They are intended to be used as code samples as well as
soundscapes. You may modify, extend, combine, and pervert them as you
wish.
<p>

If you write your own soundscapes (sound agents), you may license them
as you wish -- GPL, LGPL, some other license. Or you might choose to
not release them at all; you are not obligated to do so.
<p>

If you write a particularly interesting soundscape, you are welcome to
contribute it to the Boodler project. As a matter of consistency, I
prefer that all soundscapes that I distribute in the ./effects
directory of this package be public domain (uncopyrighted). If your
soundscape uses sounds that are not in the Boodler sound library, you
should contribute those as well. To maintain consistency (again), all
sounds in the sound library should be either public domain, or
licensed free for non-commercial use.
<p>

<h3><a name="deriving">LICENSING FOR PROGRAMMERS</a></h3>
<h4><em>(Modifying Boodler and incorporating it into other software)</em></h4>

I consider Boodler to be more like a software component than a
stand-alone program. Accordingly, I have released it under the 
<a href="LGPL">GNU Library General Public License</a>
(the LGPL). To be precise, the
workhorse parts of Boodler -- the boodle Python package, and the
modules it contains (including cboodle) -- form a library, which is
licensed under the LGPL. (The C and Python sources in the boodle and
cboodle directories are the source code to this library.)
<p>

The Python program boodler.py is simply a shell that starts up the
Boodler library. I have released boodler.py into the public domain.
You may do with it as you like. However, understand that if you write
a program that is intended to link in the Boodler library (regardless
of whether you use boodler.py), then your program is a work that uses
the library, and must behave appropriately. See the LGPL document for
details.
<p>

<h3><a name="warranty">WARRANTY</a></h3>
<h4><em>(The lack of warranty)</em></h4>

There is no warranty. See the <a href="LGPL">LGPL</a>.
