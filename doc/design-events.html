<h2>Boodler: External Events</h2>

Boodler can trigger agents in response to external events. These events are
messages received via a standard network connection. You can set up other
programs to send these messages, and thereby interface your Boodler sound
system with anything else you desire.
<p>

(A note on security: Boodler has none. If your computer is connected to
the Internet, any machine on the Internet can send events to Boodler.
As a precaution, therefore, Boodler does <em>not</em> listen for events
unless you use the <code>--listen</code> option.
If you want to use sound events, but want to exclude the outside world
from sending them, you should use some kind of firewall hardware or software.
Boodler uses port 31863; a firewall that blocks that port will block
Boodler events.)
<p>

(Another option is to give the <code>--port</code> option and specify
an absolute pathname instead of a port number. This causes Boodler to
listen on a Unix domain socket, instead of an Internet network socket.
Unix domain sockets only work within a single machine, not between
different machines, and you can use standard Unix file protections to
limit access to the socket.)
<p>

<h3>Events</h3>

An event message is a tuple of one or more strings. The first (or only)
string in the tuple is considered to be the <em>type</em> of the event.
<p>

To listen for events, you create a special type of agent. This agent sits on
a channel and waits, but it is not scheduled for a particular time. Instead,
it listens for a particular type of event. When an event of that type
arrives, the agent runs immediately. (Well, actually there's a small
delay.)
<p>

A listening agent, unlike a normal agent, does not shut down after it runs
once. It continues listening, and runs once every time an appropriate
event is received.
<p>

More than one agent can be posted to listen for a particular type of event.
When that event arrives, all the agents run simultaneously. Also,
a particular agent can be posted to listen for several types of events.
<p>

<h3>Writing a Listening Agent</h3>

A listening agent might look like this:
<p>

<pre>
class Example(EventAgent):
    name = 'listening example'
    watch_events = 'go'
    def receive(self, event):
        self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff')
</pre>

The agent is a member of <code>EventAgent</code>, which is a subclass
of <code>Agent</code> which has been specialized for event-listening.
Note that there is no <code>run()</code> method; instead, there
is a <code>receive()</code> method, which takes an extra argument for
the event.
The class also has an extra attribute:
<code>watch_events</code>. This must contain the type of event to watch
for.
<p>

You can now type:

<pre>
python boodler.py --listen bootest.Example
</pre>

Boodler will start up, but you will hear nothing. 
(Don't forget the <code>--listen</code> argument, or else you'll see
an "event listening disabled" error.)
<p>

When an <code>EventAgent</code> starts up, it posts itself to listen
for its <code>watch_events</code>. In other words, the 
<code>EventAgent</code> class has a default <code>run()</code> implementation
which looks like this:

<pre>
    def run(self):
        self.post_agent(self)
</pre>

This is usually what you want -- when the agent is scheduled (either
from the command line, or by another agent) it should begin waiting
for events. (You can, of course, override the <code>run()</code>
if you want the agent to do something more complicated.)
<p>

At any rate, our agent is still waiting patiently.
To send an event, use the <code>boomsg.py</code> program:

<pre>
python boomsg.py go
</pre>

This sends a simple message <code>('go')</code> to a listening Boodler
process -- by default, on the same machine. To send a message to a 
different machine, you would say:

<pre>
python boomsg.py --hostname machine.addr.net go
</pre>

You can also use the <code>--port</code> argument to specify a network
port number, or (if the <code>--port</code> value is an absolute pathname)
a Unix domain socket. Note that <code>--hostname</code> is ignored for
Unix domain sockets.

<h3>More Complex Listeners</h3>

The example above uses the simplest kind of event -- a single string,
which gives the event type.
You can also receive events that have more information.

<pre>
class Example(EventAgent):
    name = 'listening example'
    watch_events = 'play'
    def receive(self, event):
        snd = event[1]
        self.sched_note(snd)
</pre>

This listener listens for a <code>'play'</code> event. The agent
then extracts the name of a sound from the second element of the tuple,
and plays the sound. So you could type:

<pre>
python boomsg.py play environ/droplet-plink.aiff
</pre>

...or name any other sound in the library.

You can also check <code>event</code> to discriminate between types
of events, if your agent watches for more than one type.

<pre>
class Example(EventAgent):
    name = 'listening example'
    watch_events = ['droplet', 'heartbeat']
    def receive(self, event):
        if (event[0] == 'droplet'):
            self.sched_note('environ/droplet-plink.aiff')
        if (event[0] == 'heartbeat'):
            self.sched_note('environ/heartbeat.aiff')
</pre>

In this example, <code>watch_events</code> is a list of strings, rather
than a single string. (It could also be a function which returns a
string, or a list of strings.) The agent accepts both <code>'droplet'</code>
and <code>'heartbeat'</code> events, and plays each as a different sound.
<p>

<h3>The Event Message Protocol</h3>

You don't actually have to use <code>boomsg.py</code> to send events.
The protocol is simply a direct TCP/IP connection to port 31863.
(<code>telnet</code> will work fine.)
Each (nonempty) line sent is an event. 
The line is broken up into strings at space characters;
the resulting tuple becomes the event.
<p>

You can keep the connection open,
and send many messages in a row, if you want. Unix, Mac, or DOS linebreaks
will all work.
